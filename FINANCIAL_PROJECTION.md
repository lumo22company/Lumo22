## 7. How to use this

1. **Update the tables** in sections 3 and 5 with your own customer counts and mix.  
2. **Set your churn** once you have a few months of data and replace the 5% assumption.  
3. **Track actuals** (e.g. in a spreadsheet): MRR by plan, captions sales, then compare to this projection.  
4. **Re-run** when you change pricing (e.g. chat or bundle discount) using your current prices.

If you want, the next step can be a simple spreadsheet (e.g. CSV or Google Sheet structure) where you only change customer counts and it recalculates MRR and totals.
