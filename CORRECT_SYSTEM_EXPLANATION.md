# Correct System Architecture

## What You Actually Want

### 1. **THE SERVICE** (SaaS Booking System)
Small businesses:
- Sign up for an account
- Get access to their dashboard
- Capture leads (forms, API, webhooks)
- See AI-qualified leads automatically
- Get booking links for qualified leads
- Track everything in their dashboard
- **You charge them** (subscription or per-lead)

### 2. **THE OUTREACH** (How You Get Customers)
- Find small businesses
- Contact them to sell access to your system
- Onboard them when they sign up

## What I Need to Build

1. **User/Business Signup System**
   - Registration/login
   - Each business gets their own account
   - Business profile (name, services, etc.)

2. **Business Dashboard** (per business)
   - View their leads
   - See qualification scores
   - Manage booking links
   - Settings

3. **Lead Capture** (tied to business account)
   - Forms that capture leads for that specific business
   - API endpoints (with business API key)
   - Webhooks

4. **Billing System**
   - Track usage per business
   - Subscription or per-lead pricing
   - Payment integration

5. **Outreach System** (already built)
   - Find businesses
   - Contact them
   - Convert to customers
