**Voice**

## 2. CAPTION FRAMEWORK

### The 30-day structure

Each month is built from five rotating categories. Not every day is a hard sell; the mix keeps the feed useful, credible, and on-brand while leaving room for promotion.

| Category | Purpose | Approx. frequency per month |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------|
| **Authority / Expertise** | Establish credibility without boasting. Share perspective, experience, or a clear point of view. | 6–7 posts |
| **Educational / Value** | Answer a real question or teach something your audience can use. Builds trust and saves. | 6–7 posts |
| **Brand Personality** | Show who you are: process, philosophy, behind-the-scenes, or a take that’s recognisably you. | 6–7 posts |
| **Soft Promotion** | Mention your offer, invite a next step, or point to a lead magnet. Clear but not pushy. | 5–6 posts |
| **Engagement** | Questions, prompts, or light debate starters that invite comments and conversation. | 4–5 posts |

### Why this structure works

- **Balance:** Authority and education build trust; personality makes you memorable; soft promotion converts; engagement keeps the algorithm and your community active.
- **Predictability:** You (or your client) know what type of post each day is. No last-minute “what do I post?”
- **Consistency:** Same categories every month means the same kind of value, so the brand voice stays coherent.
- **Scalable:** Once the framework is set, new months can be generated from the same intake and tone.

[Optional: one sentence on what you’ve seen or learned that backs this up.]
