## Short product summary (paragraph)

30 Days of Social Media Captions is a done-for-you caption system. You answer a short intake form; we write a full month of on-brand captions across five categories—authority, education, personality, soft promotion, and engagement. No daily scramble, no generic filler. Clear, consistent, copy-paste ready.

---

## What’s included (bullets)

- Intake call or form — We capture your business, audience, voice, and goal for the month.
- 30 captions — One per day, structured across Authority, Educational, Brand Personality, Soft Promotion, and Engagement.
- Single document — Clean, copy-paste friendly. Delivered as Markdown or PDF.
- Optional: Suggested first-line hooks or visual directions for each caption (specify at order).

## Who it’s for

Founders and solo professionals who post themselves but don’t want to write from scratch every day. Small teams that need consistent social content without hiring a full-time copywriter. Anyone who wants a calm, professional feed—no hype, no emoji overload, no obvious AI tone.

---

## What problem it solves

- **Daily content stress** — You stop staring at a blank box. Each day has a caption ready to use or tweak.
- **Inconsistent voice** — One framework and one writer (or brief) keep your feed sounding like you.
- **Generic or sales-heavy feeds** — The mix of authority, value, personality, and soft promotion keeps the feed useful and credible, not just promotional.
