# Launch readiness — products & website (launch next week)

What’s in place and what’s left to do, so you can finish and go live.

---

## 1. What’s in place

### Website & pages
- **Landing page** (`/`) — Hero, products (Digital Front Desk, 30 Days Captions), concierge, footer, Contact = mailto
- **Plans** (`/plans`) — Email tiers £79/£149/£299, Chat add-on +£59 (5% off bundles), standalone Chat £59, correct Stripe link
- **Activate** (`/activate`) — Plan selection, optional Chat add-on, T&Cs modal, Continue to payment → correct link (email or bundle)
- **Digital Front Desk** (`/digital-front-desk`) — Product page + Activate CTAs
- **Website Chat** (`/website-chat`) — Chat Assistant £59, Get Chat Assistant → Stripe link
- **30 Days Captions** (`/captions`) — Product page, £97, Get my 30 days → payment
- **Terms** (`/terms`) — Full T&Cs (products, payment, refunds, liability, contact)
- **Success pages** — `/activate-success`, `/website-chat-success`, `/captions-thank-you`
- **404** — Custom not-found page
- **Nav/footer** — Consistent across main pages (Captions, Front Desk, Pricing, Contact)

### Digital Front Desk (email receptionist)
- Stripe: per-plan links (Starter £79, Standard £149, Premium £299) in app + webhook
- After payment: webhook sends welcome email with setup link
- Setup form: `/front-desk-setup` — business name, enquiry email, booking link → Supabase
- Inbound email: `/webhooks/sendgrid-inbound` processes replies, sends AI auto-reply
- You get: customer’s `reply-xxxxx@inbound.lumo22.com` and “Mark as connected” link
- Database: `front_desk_setups` table (you’ve run the SQL or equivalent)

### Chat Assistant
- Stripe: £59 standalone link (`CHAT_PAYMENT_LINK`) in app + webhook
- Bundles: £131 / £198 / £340 links in app; activate page uses them when “Add Chat” is checked
- Webhook: handles £59 (chat-only) → creates pending setup, sends email with setup link
- Setup: `/front-desk-setup?product=chat&t=TOKEN` — chat-only form; generates `chat_widget_key` and shows embed code
- **Widget:** Placeholder bubble only (`static/js/chat-widget.js`). No live AI chat yet (optional post-launch)

### 30 Days Captions
- Stripe: payment link + webhook for £97 (or Checkout with redirect)
- After payment: redirect to thank-you; webhook triggers intake email with link
- Intake form: `/captions-intake?t=TOKEN` — customer fills details
- Delivery: second email with 30_Days_Captions attachment (generated by your pipeline)

### Technical
- **Railway:** App deploys via `railway up`; env vars used (Stripe, SendGrid, Supabase, OpenAI, BASE_URL, payment links)
- **Stripe webhook** — Single endpoint handles: Captions £97, Front Desk £79/£149/£299, Bundles £131/£198/£340, Chat £59
- **Terms modal** — Shown before checkout on activate and chat flows

## 2. What you have left to do

### Must-do before launch (config & DNS)
- [ ] **Railway variables** — Confirm all set: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `FROM_EMAIL`, `BASE_URL`, `CHAT_PAYMENT_LINK`, `ACTIVATION_LINK_STARTER` / `STANDARD` / `PREMIUM` (or `ACTIVATION_LINK`). Optional: `ACTIVATION_LINK_*_BUNDLE` for bundles.
- [ ] **SendGrid Inbound + DNS** — So auto-reply works for Digital Front Desk:
  - SendGrid: Inbound Parse → host `inbound.lumo22.com`, URL = your Railway (or lumo22.com) + `/webhooks/sendgrid-inbound`
  - DNS: MX record for `inbound.lumo22.com` → `mx.sendgrid.net` (priority 10). See **STEP_2_SENDGRID_INBOUND_CHECKLIST.md**.
- [ ] **Stripe** — All payment links have **Success URL** set:
  - Front Desk (and bundles): `{BASE_URL}/activate-success`
  - Chat only: `{BASE_URL}/website-chat-success`
  - Captions: `{BASE_URL}/captions-thank-you`
- [ ] **Stripe webhook** — One endpoint: `{BASE_URL}/webhooks/stripe`, events include `checkout.session.completed`. Same in test or live mode as appropriate.

### Must-do before launch (content & legal)
- [ ] **Terms “Last updated”** — In `templates/_terms_content.html` or `terms.html` you have “January 2025”; change to the real go-live date if you want.
- [ ] **Contact email** — All pages use `hello@lumo22.com`; confirm that’s the inbox you’ll use for support and that SendGrid can send from it (verified sender).

### Must-do before launch (testing)
- [ ] **Digital Front Desk** — One test payment (Starter/Standard/Premium) → setup form → you receive email with `reply-xxxxx@inbound.lumo22.com` → send an email to it → you get an auto-reply.
- [ ] **Chat Assistant** — One test payment £59 → redirect to website-chat-success → you receive setup email → open setup link → submit form → see embed code (placeholder bubble is fine).
- [ ] **Bundle** — From `/activate`, select a plan, check “Add Chat”, Continue to payment → pay bundle amount → redirect to activate-success and (if you send bundle setup email) flow makes sense.
- [ ] **30 Days Captions** — One test payment → thank-you / intake link → submit intake → receive delivery email with attachment.

### Optional before launch (nice to have)
- [ ] **Custom domain** — Point lumo22.com at Railway (Railway → Networking → Custom domain + DNS). Then set `BASE_URL=https://lumo22.com` and Stripe webhook/Success URLs to lumo22.com. If you launch on Railway URL first, you can add domain later.
- [ ] **Signup/Login** — `/signup` and `/login` exist but are for “business account” (lead capture/dashboard). If you’re not using them for launch, you can leave as-is or hide from nav.
- [ ] **Chat widget** — Currently a placeholder. Real AI chat = add `POST /api/chat` and update `chat-widget.js`. Safe to launch with placeholder and add later.

### Optional after launch
- [ ] **Live Stripe** — When you’re ready for real cards, create live payment links and (if needed) live webhook; update Railway with live keys/URLs.
- [ ] **Real chat widget** — Replace placeholder with full UI calling `/api/chat` for live replies on customer sites.

## 3. One-page checklist (launch week)

| # | Task | Done |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | Railway: all env vars set (Stripe, SendGrid, Supabase, OpenAI, FROM_EMAIL, BASE_URL, payment links) | |
| 2 | SendGrid Inbound Parse: domain + URL to `/webhooks/sendgrid-inbound` | |
| 3 | DNS: MX for inbound.lumo22.com → mx.sendgrid.net | |
| 4 | Stripe: Success URLs on every payment link (activate-success, website-chat-success, captions-thank-you) | |
| 5 | Stripe: webhook URL = {BASE_URL}/webhooks/stripe, event checkout.session.completed | |
| 6 | Test: one Front Desk payment → setup → email to reply address → auto-reply | |
| 7 | Test: one Chat £59 payment → setup email → setup form → embed code | |
| 8 | Test: one Captions payment → thank-you → intake → delivery email | |
| 9 | Terms date + contact email correct | |
| 10 | (Optional) Custom domain on Railway + BASE_URL + Stripe URLs | |

## 4. Where to look for details

- **Digital Front Desk + inbound:** **DIGITAL_FRONT_DESK_STATUS_AND_GO_LIVE.md**, **STEP_2_SENDGRID_INBOUND_CHECKLIST.md**
- **Chat + bundles:** **CHAT_PRODUCT_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md**, **PRICING_STRUCTURE_NOTE.md**
- **30 Days Captions:** **CAPTIONS_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md**
- **Deploy (no GitHub):** **REDEPLOY_RAILWAY_CHECKLIST.md** — use `railway up --service "Lumo 22"`

Once the must-do config, DNS, and tests are done, the products and website are ready to launch next week. The only “product” that’s intentionally minimal is the Chat **widget** (placeholder until you add `/api/chat` and the full UI).
