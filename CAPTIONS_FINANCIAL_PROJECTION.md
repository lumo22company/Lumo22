# Lumo 22 — Financial projection (Captions only)

**Focus:** 30 Days Captions + Stories add-on when Instagram & Facebook is selected. Positioned as a complete social media tool (not just captions). **Global:** Multi-language output (EN, ES, FR, DE, PT, etc.) for worldwide launch.

---

## 1. Current revenue streams (Captions)

| Product | Price | Type |
|---------|-------|------|
| 30 Days Captions (1 platform) | £97 | One-time |
| 30 Days Captions (1 platform) | £79/mo | Subscription |
| Extra platform (2nd, 3rd, 4th) | +£29 one-off / +£19/mo | Add-on |

**Platform options:** Instagram & Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest.

**Languages (global launch):** English (UK/US), Spanish, French, German, Portuguese. Same price in GBP; Stripe handles conversion. Customer selects language for captions at intake.

---

## 2. Proposed: Stories add-on (Instagram & Facebook only)

| Add-on | Suggested price | When |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| Stories pack (30 story ideas) | +£19 one-off / +£12/mo | Only when Instagram & Facebook is selected |

**Rationale:** Stories are native to IG/FB. Offering them only when that platform is chosen keeps the add-on relevant and easy to upsell. £19 one-off aligns with the extra-platform add-on; £12/mo keeps subscription incremental.

**Alternative pricing:**
- **Premium:** £24 one-off / £15/mo — if you want a stronger “complete social media tool” anchor.
- **Light:** £14 one-off / £9/mo — if you want lower friction and higher take-up.

## 3. Example pricing (with Stories add-on)

| Customer choice | One-off | Subscription |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| 1 platform (e.g. LinkedIn only) | £97 | £79/mo |
| 1 platform + Stories (IG & FB) | £116 (£97 + £19) | £91/mo (£79 + £12) |
| 2 platforms | £126 (£97 + £29) | £98/mo (£79 + £19) |
| 2 platforms + Stories (IG & FB one of them) | £145 | £110/mo |
| 3 platforms | £155 | £117/mo |
| 3 platforms + Stories | £174 | £129/mo |

| **Non-English share (global)** | **25%** | **40%** | **55%** |

---

## 4b. Global / language assumptions

| Factor | Effect on projections |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Addressable market** | 3–5× larger (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese speakers). |
| **Conversion uplift** | +15–30% when site and product are in visitor’s language (localised UI + captions). |
| **Volume uplift** | Assume +25–40% total sales once 3+ languages are live and marketed. |
| **Regional mix (example)** | UK 45%, Spain/LATAM 25%, France 15%, Germany 10%, Other 5%. Adjust as you launch. |
| **Pricing** | Same GBP everywhere to start. Optional later: regional pricing (e.g. LATAM discount) if data supports it. |

## 6. 12‑month projection (illustrative)

### UK-only

**Assumptions:** 3 one-off sales in month 1 → 10 by month 12. 3 subs in month 1 → 30 by month 12. Stories take-up ramps from 15% to 35%. Churn 6%/mo on subs.

| Month | One-off rev | Sub MRR | Total |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 1 | £330 | £250 | £580 |
| 3 | £460 | £840 | £1,300 |
| 6 | £690 | £1,900 | £2,590 |
| 9 | £920 | £2,700 | £3,620 |
| 12 | £1,180 | £3,400 | £4,580 |

**Year 1 total (approx):** ~£28k.

### Global (multi-language launch in month 4)

**Assumptions:** Same base ramp. Global languages (ES, FR, DE, PT) go live in month 4. +25% volume from month 4–6, +35% from month 7+. Non-English share ramps to 35% by month 12.

| Month | One-off rev | Sub MRR | Total | Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------|-------|
| 1 | £330 | £250 | £580 | UK only |
| 2 | £400 | £500 | £900 | UK only |
| 3 | £460 | £750 | £1,210 | UK only |
| 4 | £550 | £950 | £1,500 | Global launch |
| 5 | £620 | £1,150 | £1,770 | +25% uplift |
| 6 | £720 | £1,400 | £2,120 | +25% uplift |
| 7 | £850 | £1,700 | £2,550 | +35% uplift |
| 8 | £980 | £2,050 | £3,030 | +35% uplift |
| 9 | £1,120 | £2,450 | £3,570 | +35% uplift |
| 10 | £1,280 | £2,850 | £4,130 | +35% uplift |
| 11 | £1,450 | £3,250 | £4,700 | +35% uplift |
| 12 | £1,620 | £3,700 | £5,320 | +35% uplift |

**Year 1 total (global):** ~£32–35k.

## 6c. Year 2+ (global, fully ramped)

| Scenario | Monthly revenue | Annual run rate |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | £2,500–3,000 | ~£30–36k |
| Moderate | £5,500–6,500 | ~£66–78k |
| Growth | £10,000–12,000 | ~£120–144k |

*Assumes global languages are live, marketed, and converting. Adjust non-English share and uplift as you get data.*

---

## 7. Positioning: “Complete social media tool”

**Impact on projections:**
- **Conversion:** Framing as “full social content” (captions + stories) can lift conversion vs “just captions”. Assume +10–20% on paid conversion if messaging is strong.
- **Retention:** Subscribers getting both captions and story ideas are more likely to stay (more value). Assume 1–2% lower churn.
- **Upsell:** Stories add-on is an easy “complete your pack” upsell at checkout or in the form.

**Messaging examples:**
- “30 days of captions and story ideas — your full social content, done.”
- “Captions for your feed, story prompts for your Stories. One pack, both covered.”
- “Complete social content for Instagram & Facebook: feed posts + Stories.”

**Global messaging:** “Available in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese. Your audience, your language.”

## 8. Costs (reminder)

| Item | Typical |
|------|---------|
| OpenAI (caption generation) | ~£0.05–0.15 per pack |
| Stripe | 1.5% + 20p per transaction |
| SendGrid | Free tier or low cost at this volume |
| Supabase | Free tier |
| Domain, hosting (Railway) | ~£5–20/mo |

At £3–4k MRR, costs are roughly £50–150/mo. Most revenue is margin.

**Next steps:**
1. Set Stories add-on price (suggest £19 / £12/mo to start).
2. Add Stories to the product when IG & FB is selected (checkbox or automatic).
3. Update copy to “complete social media tool”.
4. **Implement language selector** in intake; add target language to caption generation prompt.
5. **Prioritise languages:** EN (base) → ES → FR → DE → PT. Localise website UI for top 2–3.
6. Track: conversion rate, sub vs one-off mix, Stories take-up, churn, **language mix**, **region**.
