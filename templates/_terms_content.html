<h2>1. Agreement</h2>
<p>By purchasing or using our products and services (including 30 Days of Social Media Captions and any other Lumo 22 offerings), you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not purchase or use our services. We may make our services available globally; your use from any country is subject to these terms and to any mandatory local laws that apply in your jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>2. Products and services</h2>
<p>We provide digital products and services as described on our website. Deliverables (e.g. caption documents) are provided in the format and timeframe stated at the time of purchase. We aim to deliver within the stated timeframe (e.g. within 15 minutes for captions after you submit the form) but do not guarantee a specific delivery time.</p>
<p><strong>Story Ideas add-on.</strong> If you add the Story Ideas add-on (30 Days Story Ideas) after your initial purchase—for example from your account (Manage subscription) or by upgrading at a later date—Stories are delivered with your <strong>next</strong> caption pack, not instantly. If you want Story Ideas with your first or current pack, add the add-on at checkout before completing your order.</p>
<p><strong>Additional platforms.</strong> If you add additional platforms (e.g. a second or third platform) after your initial purchase or after submitting your intake form, captions for those platforms are delivered with your <strong>next</strong> caption pack, not instantly. If you want more platforms in your first or current pack, add them at checkout before completing your order.</p>
<p><strong>Updates to your details (intake form).</strong> Any updates or changes you make to your details (business name, tone, audience, or any other intake answers) are used for your <strong>next</strong> caption and story pack, not instantly. They do not change packs already delivered or currently in progress. Edits to your intake form are free. If you add Story Ideas or additional platforms after your initial purchase, you will need to confirm and accept the new price for those add-ons; those changes are also delivered with your next pack, not instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Refer-a-friend.</strong> If you refer a friend using your referral link or code (from your account), your friend gets 10% off their first captions purchase when they use your link. For each friend who completes a purchase, you receive 10% off your next captions subscription billing period. Discounts do not stack: if you refer two friends, you get 10% off your next two billing periods (one discount per period), not 20% off one period. Referrer discounts apply only to captions subscriptions and are applied automatically to your next invoice(s) when eligible. We may withdraw or change the refer-a-friend offer at any time; any credits already earned remain valid as described here.</p>
<p>Any goals, outcomes, or results referred to in our products (e.g. in the intake form or on the website) are for guidance and inspiration only. We do not guarantee that you will achieve any particular outcome (such as more leads, growth in following, or increased visibility) from using our content or services. Our content does not constitute legal, financial, or professional advice; use it at your own discretion.</p>

<h2>3. Payment</h2>
<p>Payment is taken at the time of purchase via our payment provider (Stripe). Prices are in GBP unless otherwise stated. You are responsible for any taxes, duties, or charges applicable in your jurisdiction. Currency conversion (if applied by your card or bank) is at their rate.</p>

<h2>4. Refunds and cancellations</h2>
<p>Because our products are digital and we begin work after you complete the form, we do not offer refunds once you have submitted the form and we have started or completed generation. If you have not yet submitted the form and wish to cancel, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@lumo22.com">hello@lumo22.com</a> and we will consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>5. Subscriptions</h2>
<p>If you purchase a subscription (e.g. monthly captions), it will renew automatically at the end of each billing period until you cancel. You can cancel at any time via your Stripe customer portal or by contacting us; cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. We may change subscription prices by giving at least 30 days’ notice; continued use after the change constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to a price change, cancel before the new price takes effect.</p>

<h2>6. Use of deliverables</h2>
<p>Once delivered, you may use the captions (or other deliverables) for your own business and social media. You may edit and adapt them. We grant you a non-exclusive licence to use the delivered content for your business purposes. You may not resell or redistribute the deliverables as a product to third parties. You must not use the content for any illegal purpose, or in any way that is defamatory, infringing, or harmful to others.</p>

<h2>7. Privacy and data</h2>
<p>Your use of our services is subject to our privacy practices as described on our website and at the time of purchase. We process personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If you are in the UK or EEA, we process data in line with UK/EU law; if you are elsewhere, we apply reasonable safeguards and comply with local requirements where we operate.</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, our liability is limited to the amount you paid for the product or service in question. We are not liable for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, or for any loss of profit, revenue, or data arising from your use of our services. Nothing in these terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.</p>

<h2>9. Events outside our control</h2>
<p>We are not liable for any failure or delay in performing our obligations where that failure or delay is due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control (e.g. natural disaster, war, terrorism, pandemic, failure of third-party systems such as payment or delivery infrastructure, or government action). If such an event continues for more than 30 days, either party may cancel the affected order or subscription and we will refund any amount paid for undelivered services.</p>

<h2>10. Consumer and statutory rights</h2>
<p>If you are a consumer, nothing in these terms affects your statutory rights under the laws of your country. In the UK, for example, your rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (or equivalent) remain unaffected. If you are outside the UK, local consumer or mandatory laws may give you additional rights; we do not exclude or limit those where they cannot be excluded or limited by agreement.</p>

<h2>11. Governing law and disputes</h2>
<p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any dispute arising from or in connection with these terms or our services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales, except that we may bring proceedings in your country of residence to enforce payment or protect our rights, and you may bring proceedings in your country of residence if you are a consumer and local law permits.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to these terms</h2>
<p>We may update these terms from time to time. The version in force at the time of your purchase applies to that purchase. For ongoing subscriptions, we will give you reasonable notice of material changes (e.g. by email or notice on our website); continued use after the change takes effect constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to the new terms, you may cancel your subscription before they take effect.</p>

<h2>13. Severability</h2>
<p>If any part of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

<h2>14. Contact</h2>
