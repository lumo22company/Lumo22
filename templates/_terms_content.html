<h2>1. Agreement</h2>
<p>By purchasing or using our products and services (including 30 Days of Social Media Captions, Digital Front Desk, Website Chat Widget, and any other Lumo 22 offerings), you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not purchase or use our services.</p>

<h2>2. Products and services</h2>
<p>We provide digital products and services as described on our website. Deliverables (e.g. caption documents) are provided in the format and timeframe stated at the time of purchase. We aim to deliver within the stated timeframe (e.g. within 15 minutes for captions after you submit the form) but do not guarantee a specific delivery time.</p>

<h2>3. Payment</h2>
<p>Payment is taken at the time of purchase via our payment provider (Stripe). Prices are in GBP unless otherwise stated. You are responsible for any taxes applicable in your jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>4. Refunds and cancellations</h2>
<p>Because our products are digital and we begin work after you complete the form, we do not offer refunds once you have submitted the form and we have started or completed generation. If you have not yet submitted the form and wish to cancel, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@lumo22.com">hello@lumo22.com</a> and we will consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>5. Use of deliverables</h2>
<p>Once delivered, you may use the captions (or other deliverables) for your own business and social media. You may edit and adapt them. We do not retain ownership of the final copy you use; we grant you a licence to use the delivered content for your business purposes. You may not resell or redistribute the deliverables as a product to third parties.</p>

<h2>6. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>Our liability is limited to the amount you paid for the product or service in question. We are not liable for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, or for any loss of profit or data arising from your use of our services.</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
<p>For questions about these terms or your order, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@lumo22.com">hello@lumo22.com</a>.</p>
