## 🎁 Free Trial Strategy

### Don't Do:
- ❌ "14 days free" (people forget, don't convert)
- ❌ "Free trial then charge" (feels like a trap)

### Do:
- ✅ **"Try it instantly"** - Your Typeform IS the trial
- ✅ **"You've just experienced it"** - They submit → get AI email → see it works
- ✅ **"7-day money-back guarantee"** - After activation, protects legally

### Your Flow:
1. Lead submits Typeform
2. Gets AI email instantly
3. Email says: "You've just used the system. Activate it for your business."
4. They click activation link → pay → onboard → live

**No calls. No selling. Just systems.**

## 🚫 What NOT to Say

- ❌ "I'm a freelancer" (sounds cheap)
- ❌ "I'll help you" (sounds like you're doing them a favor)
- ❌ "Let's hop on a call" (defeats the purpose of automation)
- ❌ "It's easy to set up" (they don't care about setup)

**Instead:**
- ✅ "I install an AI receptionist"
- ✅ "This replaces your receptionist"
- ✅ "Activate instantly"
- ✅ "No setup needed"

---

## 🎯 Conversion Optimization

### Your Typeform Questions Should:

1. **Qualify budget** - Only target people with £300+ budget
2. **Identify urgency** - Focus on "Immediately" responses
3. **Understand problem** - Use their exact words in AI email
4. **Set expectations** - "You'll hear back within 15 minutes"

### Your AI Email Should:

1. **Reference their problem** - Show you understand
2. **Position as solution** - "This solves exactly that"
3. **Make booking obvious** - "Book here" not "Let's chat"
4. **Remove friction** - No calls, no questions, just activate

### Your Activation Page Should:

1. **Show pricing clearly** - £79 / £149 / £299
2. **Compare to receptionist** - "vs £1,200/month"
3. **Show proof** - "You just experienced it"
4. **One-click activate** - No forms, just pay

## 💡 Pricing Psychology

### Why £149 Works:

- **Under £200** = Feels affordable
- **Over £100** = Feels serious (not a hobby)
- **Odd number** = Feels calculated (not rounded up)
- **Comparable to SaaS** = Feels like software, not service

### Why Not £99:

- Too close to £100 = feels like "just under £100" trick
- £149 = 50% more = feels like premium tier
- £149 vs £1,200 = 12% of cost (powerful comparison)

### Why Not £199:

- Too close to £200 = psychological barrier
- £149 feels more accessible
- You can always raise prices later
