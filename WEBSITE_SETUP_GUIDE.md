# Website Setup Guide - Pricing Page

Create a professional pricing page where customers can choose their tier.

---

## Option 1: Use the HTML File I Created (Easiest)

I've created `pricing-page.html` for you. Here's how to use it:

### Step 1: Edit the Payment Links

1. Open `pricing-page.html` in a text editor
2. Find these three lines and replace with your Stripe links:
   - `YOUR_STRIPE_STARTER_LINK_HERE` → Your £79/month Stripe link
   - `YOUR_STRIPE_STANDARD_LINK_HERE` → Your £149/month Stripe link
   - `YOUR_STRIPE_PREMIUM_LINK_HERE` → Your £299/month Stripe link

### Step 2: Host It

**Option A: Free Hosting (Easiest)**
- **Netlify Drop:** https://app.netlify.com/drop
  - Drag and drop your HTML file
  - Get instant URL (e.g., `yourname.netlify.app`)
- **GitHub Pages:** Upload to GitHub, enable Pages
- **Vercel:** Drag and drop, instant hosting

**Option B: Simple Website Builder**
- **Carrd:** https://carrd.co (free tier available)
  - Copy/paste the content
  - Add your Stripe links as buttons
- **Notion:** Create a page, publish it
- **Google Sites:** Free, simple

**Option C: Your Own Domain**
- Buy domain (e.g., `aireceptionist.co.uk`)
- Host on Netlify/Vercel (free)
- Connect domain

### Step 3: Update Your AI Email

Instead of linking directly to Stripe, link to your pricing page:

```
Activate your AI receptionist here:
https://your-pricing-page.com

Choose the plan that works for you and activate instantly.
```

## Option 2: Use a Website Builder (No Code)

### Carrd (Recommended - Free)

1. Go to https://carrd.co
2. Sign up (free)
3. Choose "Blank" template
4. Add sections:
   - **Header:** "AI Receptionist - Replace Your Receptionist for Under 10% of the Cost"
   - **Comparison:** "A receptionist costs £1,200+/month. Our AI works 24/7 for £149/month."
   - **Pricing Cards:** Add 3 cards with your tiers
   - **Buttons:** Link each to your Stripe payment links
5. Publish (get free `.carrd.co` URL or use custom domain)

### Notion (Simple)

1. Create a new Notion page
2. Add your pricing tiers
3. Add buttons linking to Stripe
4. Click "Share" → "Publish to web"
5. Get public URL
